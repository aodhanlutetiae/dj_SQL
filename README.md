This is an outline of resources and basic syntax for learning SQL for data journalism. It uses SQLite. The "Morning B" section has too much material and can be trimmed; otherwise the class structure is:

**Morning A**
- [SQL Teaching](https://www.sqlteaching.com/) (up to and including GROUP BY)
- Overview (slideshow) of databases, SQL syntax and joins for data journalism
- [Select Star](https://selectstarsql.com/) (first two or three chapters)
---
**Morning B**
- JOINs on SQLite with geog.db in [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13Pph-0FMivBNmLqudq6-Pc735FsodYkR?usp=sharing) or [SQLIME in-browser](https://sqlime.org/)
- SQLite on the command line (see Clinton emails PDF)
- SQLite in a [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1n3IO3Gi8oUuiDq4j10tcP-2Nq_R8R5sW?usp=sharing) (single table database of Tour de France, letour.db) or a [Franchise notebook](https://franchise.cloud/app/)

**Afternoon**
- Using [Datasette](https://datasette.io/) and [Queries to a Datasette of Members' Interests](https://github.com/simonw/register-of-members-interests-datasette)
