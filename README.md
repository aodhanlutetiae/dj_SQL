## dj_SQL

This is an outline of resources and basic syntax for learning SQL for data journalism. It uses SQLite. The "Morning B" section has too much material and can be trimmed; otherwise the class structure is:

**Morning A**
- [SQL Teaching](https://www.sqlteaching.com/) (up to and including GROUP BY)
- Overview (slideshow) of databases, SQL syntax and joins for data journalism
- [Select Star](https://selectstarsql.com/) (first two or three chapters)
---
**Morning B**
- SQLite on the command line (using the Clinton emails database)
- SQLite in a jupyter notebook (using a single table database of the Tour de France, letour.db)
- (Inner) JOIN and LEFT JOIN with geog.db
- [Glitch templates](https://glitch.com/@glitch/database-starters)
---
**Afternoon**
- Using [Datasette](https://datasette.io/) and [Queries to a Datasette of Members' Interests](https://github.com/simonw/register-of-members-interests-datasette)
- [SQL murder mystery](http://mystery.knightlab.com/index.html#experienced)
